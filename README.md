Amazon Website Clone Project

Welcome to my first web development projectâ€” a clone of the Amazon website created using HTML and CSS. As a web development enthusiast, I'm continually improving my skills, and this project represents my initial step into the world of web design.

Project Features:

Static Layout: This project focuses on the visual layout and structure of the Amazon website.
HTML & CSS: The entire project is built using only HTML and CSS, showcasing my understanding of these foundational web technologies.
Learning Journey: This project marks my first attempt at creating a web page, and while it may not be fully responsive, it is a significant milestone in my journey as a web developer.
Note:

As this is my first project, it may not be perfectly responsive on all devices. I'm working on improving my skills in this area.
If you find any issues or have suggestions for improvement, please feel free to leave a message. Your feedback is highly appreciated and will help me learn and grow as a developer.
Thank you for visiting my project!
